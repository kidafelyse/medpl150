                Hello, My name is Kida Felyse Bernal,
            </h1>
            <p>I tend to explore intense themes of life so I am determined to create art that showcases that focus in a monochrome dominant style. This way, intensity and focus can be emphasized in the perspective of what’s visible(lighter) versus what is hidden(darker). I find that this proves that whatever color utilized in colorful paintings and digital works of art can be just as executed in the intensity of white or black. Consider looking at a text-full sheet of paper, or a black and white picture of someone upset, which arguably has just as much to express as a colorful medium of expression. I take inspiration from 19th to early 20th century photos, a time that was booming with discovery of cultures and wars, all captured with its mere black and white photo cameras called box-cameras. Some say it was all that they could do in terms of photography, and as true this may be in today’s standards, box cameras are considered a limitation compared to the everyday complexity attached right on our phone’s lenses. However, there is something to admire about the simple capturing of gradients and intensities of white or black. I argue that like all black and white art and emotionally colorful ones, there is a gray area that, most can agree, conveys a compelling message. Artists like Ansel Adams, managed to capture such messages in his art, capturing the beautiful landscapes of America with just his brownie box cameras. Through capturing the nature of Yosemite National Park, it not only changed the genre of photography for generations to come, but his art is still admired to this day. Consider the analog artist, Sally Mann, capturing her 3 children all over her Virginia home. It was a compelling message, viewing children in the eyes of a mother while also displaying the perspective of youth and their imaginations. If the artist themselves isn’t enough, consider the black and white photos of Martin Luther King, notice how most pictures of him are in black and white despite the existing technology that allowed for them to capture him in color? This was intentional, perhaps a political move as well to make it generally appear as though the civil rights movement occurred much longer before when in fact, it is a relatively recent progress for the United States. This simple detail and intentional use of black and white provided plenty of context for its preferred use of capturing such influential civil rights leaders and their fight for equality. All these artists display such craftsmanship that I hope to achieve in my work. While I don’t expect to use box cameras just as these monochromatic photographers have, I still hope to capture just as compelling messages in the modern complexity of cameras today, with the help of digital editing and drawings of my own. Intense themes, as recalled, is something I explore and with the current age of political disparities, corruption, and economic influences, there are many emotions at play and what better way to capture such varying, overwhelming emotions than to capture it into the confines of simply black and white.</p>
