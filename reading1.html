<h1>Reflection: In Plato's Cave From On Photography by Susan Sontag</h1>
<p>
 Initially, my intent behind image taking was limited to the rhetoric that photography is to “capture the moment,”. However, while Susan Sontag would agree with this, in her analysis in “On Photography”, I have transformed my views on photo making after reading her application of Plato’s Cave to the field of photography. She’s expanded on the idea of capturing the moment, into the act of transforming the moment captured. I caught onto this notion when she explains that while photo taking was once historically used as evidence or to record, there is an undeniable difference in engaging with the experience itself because picturing something offers a lack of participation. Thus, the difference in engagement transforms the object into an interpretation of the camera taker through composition and techniques. </p>
<p>Now, my views recognize the transformation image making has. From understanding that photo taking should be true and loyal to the moment, I have gained a sort of liberty in my intent on photo making. I now hold a camera, with the intent to capture a moment in not just how an objective eye would see it, but to execute what I see and focus on, in the moment itself. Say, I am taking a picture of my mother and as I see her, she’s sitting in the park, looking off into the distance. Regardless of what my own experience gives me, I take on the liberty to focus my camera at her face, to capture the emotions of my mother because that’s my interpretation of it. It’s moved from the need to loyally capture the moment, but rather, focus on the object of choice, which is the face of my mother, smiling into the distance, only capturing the background partly so it hints that she is in the park.</p>
 <p>Yet, through Sontag’s analysis, I can accept that regardless of intent behind the camera, just by taking an image of an object, creates this open discussion of interpretation in the distribution of the photo. While the image of my mother to me is a capturing of her in the moment of bliss at a park, to the objective eye, it can still represent varying interpretations such as simply a woman smiling. With recognizing this difference in engagement, I look beyond capturing and approach photo taking with more intent with the compositions and techniques applied. I am liberated to capture beyond what is in the moment, and tweak and fiddle with it, with a sort of “might as well emphasize my interpretation” attitude. This way, I can approach the captured moment with an intent to apply my interpretation of it just as an audience would, hence, expanding on simply a captured moment or object in of itself.</p>
<p>Such is the case with my intent to capture intense themes of life in my upcoming projects and connect them. In playing along with my creative intentions with art and my new intentions with photo making, I could use the picture of my mother smiling at the park and strategically edit in an out-of-place picture of a tear near her eye. This has expanded the context, to even the objective eye since such a contradiction of smiling and an out-of-place tear, creates contradiction for the objective eye and inspires questions. Could the tear represent a lingering sad emotion behind the smile? Perhaps a smile out of the sense of peace after losing a loved one? Does the appearance of it being out of place suggest an unrelated emotion that is still connected to her present feelings of peace? Through my now liberated intent behind photo-making and applications of various compositions and techniques, I can truly capture the intense themes of life with even the simplest captured moments for the unparticipating, observer.</p>
